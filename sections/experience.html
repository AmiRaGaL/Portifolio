    <h2 class="text-center text-primary mb-5">Experience</h2>
    <p class="lead text-center mb-5" data-aos="fade-up" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
  I started my career as a Software Developer at <strong>Infosys (Client: Verizon)</strong>, where I spent three years building
  <strong>Pega Decisioning and automation systems</strong> that powered large-scale marketing operations. Leading
  the <em>Publish Module</em> and working directly with Verizon's architects taught me what it takes to design systems that scale.
  <br><br>
  To deepen my technical foundation, I pursued a <strong>Master's in Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Massachusetts Lowell</strong>,
  concentrating on <strong>AI and Healthcare</strong>. My thesis explored a new approach to <strong>ordinal severity prediction</strong> in opioid-related
  clinical notes using transformer models and active learning techniques.
  <br><br>
  At the same time, I worked as a <strong>Graduate Assistant</strong> in the Dean's Office of the Manning School of Business. As the only CS engineer
  on the team, I <strong>automated grading, analytics, and event operations</strong> using Python, FastAPI, and Tableau, which helped
  free up staff time for more strategic work.
  <br><br>
  Whether building <strong>decisioning engines</strong> or developing <strong>AI-driven automation pipelines</strong>, my work connects
  enterprise software with intelligent systems. This aligns with my long-term passion for <strong>IoT and home automation</strong>,
  a space I believe companies like <strong>Amazon</strong> are positioned to transform.
