    <p class="lead text-center mb-5" data-aos="fade-up" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
  I began my career at <strong>Infosys</strong>, working with <strong>Verizon</strong> for three years on <strong>Pega Decisioning and automation systems</strong> that ran their marketing operations at scale. I led the <em>Publish Module</em> and got to work closely with Verizon's architects, which taught me a lot about building systems that actually work under pressure.
  <br><br>
  I wanted to go deeper technically, so I went back to school for a <strong>Master's in Computer Science</strong> at <strong>UMass Lowell</strong>, focusing on <strong>AI and Healthcare</strong>. My thesis was all about predicting <strong>severity levels</strong> in opioid-related clinical notes using transformer models and active learning. During grad school, I also worked as a <strong>Graduate Assistant</strong> in the Dean's Office, where I automated grading, analytics, and event operations with Python, FastAPI, and Tableau.
  <br><br>
  Now I'm working as a <strong>Full-Stack Engineer at OurFreedom.ai</strong>, building social networking features with <strong>NestJS, React Native, and MongoDB</strong>. I'm handling everything from backend APIs and voice communication to content moderation and CI/CD - basically architecting production systems that scale.
  <br><br>
  Whether it's <strong>decisioning engines</strong>, <strong>AI automation pipelines</strong>, or <strong>full-stack social platforms</strong>, I love building systems that connect people and technology. It ties back to my longtime interest in <strong>IoT and home automation</strong> - a space where companies like <strong>Amazon</strong> are doing really exciting things.
