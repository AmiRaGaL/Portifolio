    <h2 class="text-center text-primary mb-5">Experience</h2>
    <p class="lead text-center mb-5" data-aos="fade-up" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
  I began my journey as a Software Developer at <strong>Infosys (Client: Verizon)</strong>, where I spent three years designing
  <strong>Pega Decisioning and automation systems</strong> that power large-scale marketing operations. My experience leading
  the <em>Publish Module</em> and collaborating directly with Verizon architects sparked a passion for scalable system design.
  <br><br>
  To expand my technical foundation, I pursued a <strong>Master’s in Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Massachusetts Lowell</strong>,
  focusing on <strong>AI and Healthcare</strong>. My thesis introduced a framework for <strong>ordinal severity prediction</strong> in opioid-related
  clinical notes using transformer models and active learning.
  <br><br>
  Parallelly, I served as a <strong>Graduate Assistant</strong> in the Dean’s Office of the Manning School of Business — the only CS engineer
  on the team — where I <strong>automated grading, analytics, and event operations</strong> through Python, FastAPI, and Tableau, freeing
  staff resources for higher-value initiatives.
  <br><br>
  From building <strong>decisioning engines</strong> to developing <strong>AI-driven automation pipelines</strong>, my journey bridges the gap between
  enterprise software and intelligent systems — aligning closely with my long-term interest in <strong>IoT and home automation</strong>,
  a domain I believe companies like <strong>Amazon</strong> will revolutionize.
